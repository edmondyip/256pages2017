      <h2>Front-end</h2>
      <p>I design this website for my portfolio. Not the projects page, this is just a practice. This website created by different tech i know.</p>
      <p>This website used VueJs as main framework, on a ubuntu server and using nginx for reverse proxy server. I generated static html by server side rendering, for better site performance and SEO crawling allowable.</p>
